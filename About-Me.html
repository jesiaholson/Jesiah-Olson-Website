                        <p>Hello everyone! My name is Jesiah, I'm a roller coaster/theme park enthusiast, and I guess I'm just a kid with a dream to open a theme park. Around the age of 7, my family moved to Orange County, California, where I spent most of my childhood. Starting with season passes to Disney, we would go 2-3 times a month as a family which gave me an exposure to theme parks early on. Rides like Splash Mountain, Tower of Terror, the former California Screamin', Indiana Jones Adventure, etc… were all a very big part of my childhood. As a 7-year-old, I had the entire park mapped out mentally down to the rock and tree, and spending time immersed in such a heavily themed place did wonders for my imagination. While I loved being at home, Disney felt like it just belonged.</p>
                        <p>Age eventually caught up to me though, and by the time I was 13 I was ready for something new and more thrilling. Seeing this change, my parents offered to start taking us to Knott’s Berry Farm, which we did for a season. I’d been as a kid but never rode anything more intense than GhostRider. While I too loved Knott’s after riding rides like Xcelerator, I still found myself preferring Disney… And that’s when I visited Six Flags. Six Flags for me was the pinnacle of all things, and having visited my first time with a broken arm, I was only able to experience a few rides – which was funny because I ended up crying on their Arrow Dynamics Mega-Looper Viper, as well as Drop of Doom. Still, I was mesmerized by the sheer size and scale of the roller coasters at that park, and immediately wanted to learn more.</p>
                        <p>I began to take pictures of the coasters and research them online, before creating an Instagram account called National Coasters in 2018, where I would upload the photos and write a description about the roller coasters. This developed into a bit of an obsession, and I made the goal to post one new coaster a day from around the world. A couple years later, I had 10,000 followers and was posting all sorts of rides. Most popular were my posts on weird and obscure coasters in other countries, which led to a ton of requests for a YouTube page. This then prompted me to hire an editor, and that page quickly surpassed 10,000 subscribers as well. Today, the channel has amassed well over 100,000 wonderful followers, subscribers, and viewers – all of which I’m extremely grateful for. The rest is still in the making.</p>

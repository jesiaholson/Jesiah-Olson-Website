                        <h2>1. Wild Rivers Waterpark</h2>
                        <p>In 2021, Wild Rivers Waterpark made a comeback when construction started mid-way through the year. During this time, I was hired as the President of Social Media for the park and was in charge of all media. I spent hours every day watching the park get built from the ground-up and interacting with construction crews… By the time the park was open, I worked with the company at a high-level, helping with marketing. This gave me skills in communication, time-management, work, and thinking. It was amazing to see a theme park come to life from the ground up.</p>
                        <h2>2. Amusement Companies</h2>
                        <p>Over the course of my time in the amusement world, one of the most frequent and influential opportunities I’ve had is the ability to interact with theme parks and design companies. Major projects I’ve been involved in include: The re-design and opening of the Riddler Mindbender at Six Flags Over Georgia, the testing and background of S&S Worldwide’s prototype coaster Axis, steps to opening a theme park with Bill Marriott, the creation of roller coaster track with Intermountain Lift.</p>
                        <h2>3. Travel</h2>
                        <p>Another great thing I’ve been able to experience is travel. Thanks to an adventurous family and my love for theme parks, I’ve visited 15 countries for various reasons and seen what they’ve had to offer. Different cultures, travel itineraries, budgeting, and living has taught me so much to apply in business. Whether trips were done by myself or with friends and family, my growth as a person and in life has increased by a substantial amount.</p>
